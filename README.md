# DanskeAsssignment_2020_CCP

Assignment:
-----------
Please create a small program that takes a number of rectangles as input. The program should then output the rectangles in sorted order with respect to area. For each rectangle, it also should print whether the rectangle is flat, tall or square.

* Please pay attention to the organization and completeness of your solution and include unit tests.
* The solution must be coded in C#. Console, GUI and other application types are welcome.

Usage:
------
`MainApp.exe [inputfile] [outputfile (optional)]`

where:
###
    [inputfile]  -   a list of shapes (rectangles), see data format below`
    [outputfile] -   if omitted - output goes to the standard console`


Expected input data format: 
--------------------------
`N` lines of four comma- or tab-separated double precision values.

Each line stores rectangle's horizontal and vertical positions, as well as its width and height values, e.g.:

* example 1: `54	-65	798	361` => rectangle at `(x:54,y:-65)`, having `width:798` and `height:361`. 
* example 2: `72,30,240,81`   => rectangle at `(x:72,y:30)`,  having `width:240` and `height:81`.
